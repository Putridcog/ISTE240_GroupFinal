                  We visited Varazdin during the summer mainly because of Spancirfest. During Spancirfest, the city becomes the capital of music, the kingdom of theatre and realm of beauty created by the magic hands of artists. The streets and squares of the historic core, where the festival lives, become too tight. And tens of thousands of visitors ruled together with artists and musicians by those streets.

    				Because we add a little bit of studying in every trip we take, we had to visit some sights.Varazdin as a city has a rich history, great art, great museums, and baroque buildings, so we visited most of them so our students learned a lot about their country’s history.
