                Ozalj is a small town located near Karlovac. This town is interesting mainly because it was home of the royal Croatian family Zrinski. Since this town was basically owned by the royals, they have built their own fortress called the Ozalj castle.

                    At first it was just a stronghold, which was later renovated by the Zrinski into a castle. This castle is notorious for its history, because it was place where the Zrinski-Frankopan conspiracy happened.

                    The city is also known for their carnival which is small, however their masks are traditional which attracts lots of people. 
                    On this trip we have visited the Zrinski castle and its museum and libraries.
