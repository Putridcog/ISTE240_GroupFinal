                    Daruvar is located the central in the central part of Croatia, the western part of the province of Slavonia. It is located 125km from the capital Zagreb and about 130km from Osijek. It is located in a hilly area at the foot of the Papuk mountain, in the Poilean Plateau, on fertile grounds from the Pleistocene. <br>

					As a student home, we will visit various Daruvar sights, learn about Daruvar’s historic core, visit museums and talk to local people to get to know the city’s most important events there. Daruvar is a very interesting city, and we are certain that our students will love Daruvar’s spa.

                     The carnival in Rijeka is held every year in February since 1982. It is the biggest carnival in Croatia, so we had to take our students to have a look. During the time of the carnival, there are organized carnival parades that are going through town. Each year there are many groups that have a same mask and walk through town greeting the carnival goers. The biggest event happened in 2001 when there were 144 group masks participating in the carnival, which were seen by more than 140 000 carnival goers.
